📚 Concepts Used

Class: A blueprint for creating objects.

Inheritance: Child classes (Car, Plane, Boat) inherit from a parent class (Vehicle).

Polymorphism: All vehicle types use a move() method, but each one behaves differently.

Method Overriding: Each subclass overrides the move() method of the base class.
